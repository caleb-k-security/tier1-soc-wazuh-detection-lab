# Tier-1 SOC Detection and Incident Response Lab Using Wazuh

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a functional Tier-1 Security Operations Center (SOC) lab using Wazuh SIEM, Sysmon endpoint telemetry, and controlled attack simulation.

The objective was to simulate real-world SOC analyst responsibilities including detection, investigation, analysis, and incident documentation.

## Lab Architecture

Kali Linux (Attacker) → Windows Endpoint → Wazuh Server → SIEM Alerts → Analyst Investigation

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* SIEM deployment and configuration
* Endpoint telemetry collection
* Threat detection and alert triage
* Log analysis and correlation
* Incident investigation
* Threat intelligence enrichment
* SOC ticket documentation
* Escalation decision making

---

## Attack Scenarios Simulated

* Brute-force authentication attack
* Phishing email investigation
* Malware execution detection (EICAR test file)

---

## Key SOC Analyst Competencies Proven

* Distinguishing false positives vs real threats
* Identifying attack patterns from logs
* Correlating events across sources
* Writing professional incident reports
* Applying MITRE ATT&CK reasoning
* Making escalation decisions

---

## Tools Used

* Wazuh SIEM
* Sysmon
* VirtualBox
* Kali Linux
* Windows 10
* VirusTotal
* AbuseIPDB

---

## Outcome

The lab successfully generated real alerts, validated detection logic, and demonstrated analyst-level investigation workflows aligned with enterprise SOC operations.

---

## Analyst Statement

This project demonstrates hands-on SOC analyst capability equivalent to real Tier-1 operational responsibilities.
